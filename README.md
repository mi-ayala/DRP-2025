# DRP-2025
The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate students to explore and learn more about mathematical research on a specific topic. It includes weekly meetings with an assigned mentor and the writing of a report including what the student learned and the results discovered.

This is the project of Charles-Étienne Lessard mentored by Miguel Ayala. The mathematical topics covered are dynamical systems and numerical analysis. Our goal is to implement numerical algorithms in Julia to find the steady states of a complicated ODE system. This system of ODEs contains two different parameters, and we would like to plot different measurements of the steady states as these parameters are varied. This will allow us at the same time to identify potential bifurcations.

This repository includes a 6 page report on the goal, the analysis and the results of the project. It also includes a PowerPoint presentation that I used to give a 10 minute presentation about this project in front of 40 graduate and undergraduate students. Finally, it includes all the Julia codes needed to implement and solve the system of ODE's, as well as the different librairies to plot different results.
