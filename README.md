# DRP-2025
The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate students to explore and learn more about mathematical research on a specific topic. It includes weekly meetings with an assigned mentor and the writing of a report including what the student learned and the results discovered.

This is the project of Charles-Ã‰tienne Lessard mentored by Miguel Ayala. The mathematical topics covered are dynamical systems and numerical analysis. Our goal was to implement numerical algorithms in Julia to find the steady states of a complicated ODE system. This system of ODE's contains two different parameters, and we would like to plot different measurements on the steady states as these parameters are varied. This brought us to studying a bifurcation leading to a symmetry breaking phenomenon.

This repository includes a 7 page report on the goal, the analysis and the results of the project. It also includes a PowerPoint presentation that I used to give a 10 minutes presentation about this project in front of 40 graduate and undergraduate students. Finally, it includes all the Julia codes needed to implement and solve the system of ODE's, as well as the different librairies used to plot the different results.  All the plots used in the PowerPoint and the report were created using our Julia implementation.
