# DRP-2025
The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate students to explore and learn more about mathematical research on a specific topic. It includes weekly meetings with an assigned mentor and the writing of a report including what the student learned and the results discovered.

This is the project of Charles-Ã‰tienne Lessard mentored by Miguel Ayala. The mathematical topics covered are dynamical systems and numerical analysis. Our goal is to implement numerical algorithms in Julia to find the steady states of a complicated ODE system. This system of ODEs contains two different parameters, and we would like to plot different measurements of the steady states as these parameters are varied. This will allow us at the same time to identify potential bifurcations.
